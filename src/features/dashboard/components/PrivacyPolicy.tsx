        OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY PROTECTION At DARWWIN and at our subsidiaries
        (collectively “We”, “Our” or “Us”), an important part of our commitment
        to provide you with service excellence is our respect for your right to
        privacy. Keeping our customers' and employees’ information and affairs
        in strict confidence is a cornerstone of our business. The range of
        products and services we offer our customers continues to expand, and
        the technology we use continues to change. But, no matter how our
        business changes, we will always protect your privacy. The policies and
        procedures which we practice in order to protect your privacy are in
        place across our firm. In the following pages we describe these policies
        and procedures and how we put them into practice so that you have
        control over how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.
        Protecting Your Privacy Means: We keep your personal information and the
        business you do with us in strict confidence Your personal information
        is not sold to, rented to, leased to, or shared with, third parties
        without your consent You have control over how we obtain, uses, and
        gives out personal information about you You have access to the personal
        information we have about you We respect your privacy when we market our
        products and services SECTION 1 - Accountability We are accountable for
        the protection of your personal information. While senior management is
        ultimately accountable for the protection of that information, the
        day-to-day monitoring for compliance may be delegated to staff. While we
        have procedures in place to assist our employees in the practice of our
        privacy policies, the overall responsibility for the protection of
        personal information, and compliance with this policy rests with Our
        Privacy Officer. We use various third parties to process and store
        information. It is Our responsibility to ensure that the written
        contract with the outside party will afford a comparable level of
        protection while such third party is processing the personal
        information. This will usually mean the provision of a copy of this
        policy to such third party and the written acknowledgement from such
        third party that it will be bound by the policy. Further provisions
        include the return of all personal information to us upon completion, an
        agreement not to use such information except for the purposes of us, and
        the destruction of any remaining records in the possession of the third
        party. Finally the third party must agree to advise us immediately of
        any concerns, or objections expressed, relating to personal information
        of our clients and employees. We are committed to ensuring that the
        appropriate security measures are employed in the transfer of sensitive
        information. However, in relation to e-mail or wireless communication,
        complete confidentiality and security is not assured. We are not
        accountable for any damages suffered when a customer or employee
        transmits personal information through e-mail or wireless communication
        or when We transmit personal information to a client on request. SECTION
        2 - Identifying the Purposes of Personal Information There are certain
        specific reasons why we need to collect information about you: Besides
        your name, address and telephone number, we need information to:
        understand your needs and eligibility for products and services
        recommend particular products and services that are suitable to you
        maintain appropriate levels of service establish your identity and
        provide contact information for you protect you and us from error and
        fraud comply with legal and regulatory requirements When opening an
        interest bearing or investment account, the Income Tax Act and other
        obligations require us to ask for your Social Insurance Number or other
        tax identification number When opening an account that may hold U.S.
        securities or has U.S. beneficial owners, we have contractual
        obligations with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to ask for U.S.
        Taxpayer Identification Numbers and/or other citizenship or residential
        identification information When opening an account, in order to assess
        your creditworthiness we ask you for certain financial information. For
        this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit bureaus to give us
        information on your credit history For our employees - to provide
        benefits and manage the employment relationship We may review and
        analyze your use of products and services, including transactions in
        your accounts, to help protect you from unauthorized use of your
        accounts, to help us serve you better, to comply with our own
        supervisory requirements, and to bring other products and services to
        your attention which we feel will be of benefit to you. In this regard
        We may monitor telephone communications from time-to-time. We collect,
        uses and discloses personal information only for purposes that a
        reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. We
        generally use such personal information to carry on its business and
        serve its customers as described above. If the business is transferred
        to a new owner, the personal information will also be transferred
        subject to the limitations of Section 5. SECTION 3 - Consent to
        Collection and Use We obtain your consent before we: Check your

        persons, personal information about you unless We are obliged to do so
        by law or to protect our interests Use your personal information in any
        way we didn't tell you about previously Express consent can be verbal or
        written. For example, when applying for an account you give us your
        written consent for us to obtain a credit report. You imply consent when
        we can reasonably conclude that you’ve consented to the use of your
        personal information, through your action or inaction. For example, if
        in the course of your using your investment account, we are required to
        use an outside company to maintain your account data, we can conclude
        that you have consented to our providing your information to the outside
        company. You can withdraw your consent any time after you've given it to
        us, provided there are no legal requirements to prevent this. If you
        don't consent to certain uses of personal information, or if you
        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a
        particular product or service and we may not be able to provide service
        to you at all. We do not use personal information or release that
        information to anyone outside of us without your consent. There are some
        exceptions to the above rules. For example, we may collect, use or
        disclose personal information without your consent if we: Must use an
        outside company to process or store information At times we use the
        expertise of an outside company to do work for us involving some of your
        information for example, processing your account information or the

        select the company carefully and confirm that it uses security standards
        comparable to those of us. Must disclose information for legal or
        contractual reasons We may be compelled to release your information by a
        court of law, or by another legal authority, regulatory authority, or
        governmental body. In any case, our policy is to release information
        only to the extent that we are required to do so. For regulatory
        purposes, national investment industry regulators, stock exchanges and
        self-regulatory organizations ("Regulators") may require access to
        personal information of current and former clients, employees, agents,
        directors, officers, partners and others that has been collected or used
        by persons or firms under their jurisdiction (“Regulated Persons”).

        from such Regulated Persons for regulatory purposes, including but not

        compliance, trade desk review and other regulatory audits, Investigation
        of potential regulatory and statutory violations, Regulatory databases,

        beneficial owners. Must protect the interests of us In certain
        circumstances, we may be required to collect, use or release information
        for its protection. For example, we may do so when collecting an overdue
        account, when defending a legal action, to detect or prevent fraud, or
        to detect or prevent any other illegal or improper activity. Are acting

        (disclosed) to the new owner, subject to certain conditions. Either the
        new owner must agree to maintain and abide by Our then existing Privacy
